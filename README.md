# Transaction Management App
----

This application displays and manages a list of transactions. 
- It includes several components that work together to fetch, filter, and display transaction data, as well as to delete specific transactions.

## Components
### 1. Transaction

This component represents a single transaction row in the table data.

The Props:

- `transtion`: This is an __*object*__ containing the transaction data __(date, description, category, amount, id)__.
- `onDelete`: A function that handles the deletion of a transaction by its own ID.

## 2. TransactionsList

This component manages the list of transactions, including fetching data from the server, filtering, and deleting.

__State__:

- `transactions`: Stores all transactions fetched from the server.

- `filteredTransactions`: Stores the transactions that match the current search.
 
A Key Function:

- `handleDelete`: This Removes a transaction from the list by filtering it out.

## 3. SearchBar

This component provides a search input to filter out transactions.

The Props:

- `onSearch`: A function to handle any search input change.

## 4. FilterTransactions

This component filters transactions based on the search input.

State:

- `searchTerm`: Stores the current search term.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
